# LGM-Classification
A python library for accurate classification of Points of Interest (POIs) into categories.

#About LGM-Classification
LGM-Classification is a python library implementing a full Machine LEarning workflow for training classification algorithms on annotated POI datasets and producing models for the accurate classification of Points of Interest (POIs) into categories. LGM-Classification implements a series of training features, regarding the properties POIs and their relations with neighboring POIs. Further, it it encapsulates grid-search and cross-validation functionality, based on the [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/) toolkit, assessing as series of classification models and parameterizations, in order to find the most fitting model for the data at hand.
